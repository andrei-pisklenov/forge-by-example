# Forge: Attachments Count Custom field

It is a repository for a video where we build an "Attachments Count" calculated custom field in Forge from zero to a working app—and I’m not skipping the messy parts! 🐞

In real-world development, you don’t follow a perfect success path. You hit bugs, unexpected issues, and roadblocks—and that’s where the real learning happens! This video shows the full journey, including debugging, investigating, and solving problems.

If you’ve ever felt stuck when things didn’t go as planned, this one’s for you. Mistakes make you a better developer! 💪
