It is a repository for a video where we build an "Attachments Count" calculated custom field in Forge from zero to a working app—and I'm not skipping the messy parts! 🐞

In real-world development, you don't follow a perfect success path. You hit bugs, unexpected issues, and roadblocks—and that's where the real learning happens! This video shows the full journey, including debugging, investigating, and solving problems.
